                Full stack web developer with a passion for arts and creativity.
                Recently earned a certificate in Full stack development through the
                University of Minnesota, with experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript and
                responsive web design. I am excited to give a company a creative and
                observant team member, with the ability to adapt for whatever position
                needed. I am ready to give my ideas and input on import development
                decisions that are made.
